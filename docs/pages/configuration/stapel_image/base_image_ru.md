Here's a minimal `werf.yaml`. It describes a _image_ named `example` that is based on a _base image_ named `alpine`:

```yaml
project: my-project
configVersion: 1
---
image: example
from: alpine
```

_Base image_ can be declared with `from`, `fromImage` or `fromImageArtifact` directive.

## from, fromLatest

The `from` directive defines the name and tag of a _base image_. If absent, tag defaults to `latest`.

```yaml
from: <image>[:<tag>]
```

By default, the assembly process does not depend on actual _base image_ digest in the repository, only on _from_ directive value.
Thus, changing _base image_ locally or in the repository does not matter if _from_ stage is already exists in _stages storage_.

If you want always build the image with actual _base image_ you should use _fromLatest_ directive.
_fromLatest_ directive allows connecting the assembly process with the _base image_ digest getting from the repository.
```yaml
fromLatest: true
```

> Pay attention, werf uses actual _base image_ digest as extra _from_ stage dependency if _fromLatest_ is true.
Therefore, using this directive implies not reproducible signatures:
after changing _base image_ in repository, all previously built stages, also like related images, become not usable.
The problem might occur:
- between jobs of one pipeline (e.g. build and deploy) or
- when you rerun the previous job (e.g. deploy)

## fromImage and fromImageArtifact

Besides using docker image from a repository, the _base image_ can refer to _image_ or [_artifact_]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/configuration/stapel_artifact.html), that is described in the same `werf.yaml`.

```yaml
fromImage: <image name>
fromImageArtifact: <artifact name>
```

If a _base image_ is specific to a particular application,
it is reasonable to store its description with _images_ and _artifacts_ which are used it as opposed to storing the _base image_ in a registry.

Also, this method can be useful if the stages of _stage conveyor_ are not enough for building the image. You can design your _stage conveyor_.

## fromCacheVersion

The `fromCacheVersion` directive allows to manage image reassembly.

```yaml
fromCacheVersion: <arbitrary string>
```
